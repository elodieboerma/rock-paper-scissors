This is the classic rock, paper, scissors game, but virtual. This is my first JavaScript project with The Odin Project.

*bugs/errors to fix: *

- take out lines that log the current scores before the end of the game
    -> scores will only log at very end when winner is declared
- need to test again after these to see if there are other errors or any logic errors
